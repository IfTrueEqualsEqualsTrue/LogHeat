# Temperature Logger

This project is a temperature logging system developed during the 2024 Biomedical Engineering Master Class at Grenoble INP. The system is designed to record temperature data in real-time, offering students practical experience in data acquisition, processing, and visualization, relevant to biomedical applications.

## Features
- **Real-time temperature logging**: Captures temperature data from a connected sensor.
- **Data storage**: Saves logged data for later analysis.
- **Data visualization**: Provides a graphical interface for displaying temperature trends over time.
- **Simple UI**: User-friendly interface for ease of use by non-technical users.
  
## Hardware Requirements
- Temperature sensor (compatible with the system)
- Computer running Python
